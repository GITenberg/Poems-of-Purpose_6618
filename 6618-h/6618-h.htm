<h2><a name="page1"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 1</span>A GOOD
SPORT</h2>
<p class="poetry">I <span class="smcap">was</span> a little lad,
and the older boys called to me from the pier:<br />
They called to me: &lsquo;Be a sport: be a sport!&nbsp; Leap in
and swim!&rsquo;<br />
I leaped in and swam, though I had never been taught a stroke.<br
/>
Then I was made a hero, and they all shouted:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &lsquo;Well done!&nbsp; Well done,<br />
Brave boy, you are a sport, a good sport!&rsquo;<br />
And I was very glad.</p>
<p class="poetry">But now I wish I had learned to swim the right
way,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Or had never learned at all.<br />
Now I regret that day,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; For it led to my fall.</p>
<p class="poetry">I was a youth, and I heard the older men
talking of the road to wealth;<br />
They talked of bulls and bears, of buying on margins,<br />
<a name="page2"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 2</span>And they
said, &lsquo;Be a sport, my boy, plunge in and win or lose it
all!<br />
It is the only way to fortune.&rsquo;<br />
So I plunged in and won; and the older men patted me on the
back,<br />
And they said, &lsquo;You are a sport, my boy, a good
sport!&rsquo;<br />
And I was very glad.</p>
<p class="poetry">But now I wish I had lost all I ventured on
that day&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Yes, wish I had lost it all.<br />
For it was the wrong way,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And pushed me to my fall.</p>
<p class="poetry">I was a young man, and the gay world called me
to come;<br />
Gay women and gay men called to me, crying:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &lsquo;Be a sport; be a good sport!<br />
Fill our glasses and let us fill yours.<br />
We are young but once; let us dance and sing,<br />
And drive the dull hours of night until they stand at bay<br />
Against the shining bayonets of day.&rsquo;<br />
So I filled my glass, and I filled their glasses, over and over
again,<br />
<a name="page3"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 3</span>And I sang
and danced and drank, and drank and danced and sang,<br />
And I heard them cry, &lsquo;He is a sport, a good
sport!&rsquo;<br />
As they held their glasses out to be filled again.<br />
And I was very glad.</p>
<p class="poetry">Oh the madness of youth and song and dance and
wine,<br />
Of woman&rsquo;s eyes and lips, when the night dies in the arms
of dawn!<br />
And now I wish I had not gone that way.<br />
Now I wish I had not heard them say,<br />
&lsquo;He is a sport, a good sport!&rsquo;<br />
For I am old who should be young.<br />
The splendid vigour of my youth I flung<br />
Under the feet of a mad, unthinking throng.<br />
My strength went out with wine and dance and song;<br />
Unto the winds of earth I tossed like chaff,<br />
With idle jest and laugh,<br />
The pride of splendid manhood, all its wealth<br />
Of unused power and health&mdash;<br />
Its dream of looking into some pure girl&rsquo;s eyes<br />
And finding there its earthly paradise&mdash;<br />
<a name="page4"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 4</span>Its hope of
virile children free from blight&mdash;<br />
Its thoughts of climbing to some noble height<br />
Of great achievement&mdash;all these gifts divine<br />
I cast away for song and dance and wine.<br />
Oh, I have been a sport, a good sport;<br />
But I am very sad.</p>
<h2><a name="page5"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 5</span>A SON
SPEAKS</h2>
<p class="poetry"><span class="smcap">Mother</span>, sit down,
for I have much to say<br />
Anent this widespread ever-growing theme<br />
Of woman and her virtues and her rights.</p>
<p class="poetry">I left you for the large, loud world of men,<br
/>
When I had lived one little score of years.<br />
I judged all women by you, and my heart<br />
Was filled with high esteem and reverence<br />
For your angelic sex; and for the wives,<br />
The sisters, daughters, mothers of my friends<br />
I held but holy thoughts.&nbsp; To fallen stars<br />
(Of whom you told me in our last sweet talk,<br />
Warning me of the dangers in my path)<br />
I gave wide pity as you bade me to,<br />
Saying their sins harked back to my base sex.</p>
<p class="poetry"><a name="page6"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
6</span>Now listen, mother mine: Ten years have passed<br />
Since that clean-minded and pure-bodied youth,<br />
Thinking to write his name upon the stars,<br />
Went from your presence.&nbsp; He returns to you<br />
Fallen from his altitude of thought,<br />
Hiding deep scars of sins upon his soul,<br />
His fair illusions shattered and destroyed.<br />
And would you know the story of his fall?</p>
<p class="poetry">He sat beside a good man&rsquo;s honoured
wife<br />
At her own table.&nbsp; She was beautiful<br />
As woods in early autumn.&nbsp; Full of soft<br />
And subtle witcheries of voice and look&mdash;<br />
His senior, both in knowledge and in years.</p>
<p class="poetry">The boyish admiration of his glance<br />
Was white as April sunlight when it falls<br />
Upon a blooming tree, until she leaned<br />
So close her rounded body sent quick thrills<br />
Along his nerves.&nbsp; He thought it accident,<br />
And moved a little; soon she leaned again.<br />
The half-hid beauties of her heaving breast<br />
Rising and falling under scented lace,<br />
The teasing tendrils of her fragrant hair,<br />
With intermittent touches on his cheek,<br />
<a name="page7"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 7</span>Changed the
boy&rsquo;s interest to a man&rsquo;s desire.<br />
She saw that first young madness in his eyes<br />
And smiled and fanned the flame.&nbsp; That was his fall;<br />
And as some mangled fly may crawl away<br />
And leave his wings behind him in the web,<br />
So were his wings of faith in womanhood<br />
Left in the meshes of her sensuous net.</p>
<p class="poetry">The youth, forced into sudden manhood, went<br
/>
Seeking the lost ideal of his dreams.<br />
He met, in churches and in drawing-rooms,<br />
Women who wore the mask of innocence<br />
And basked in public favour, yet who seemed<br />
To find their pleasure playing with men&rsquo;s hearts,<br />
As children play with loaded guns.&nbsp; He heard<br />
(Until the tale fell dull upon his ears)<br />
The unsolicited complaints of wives<br />
And mothers all unsatisfied with life,<br />
While crowned with every blessing earth can give<br />
Longing for God knows what to bring content,<br />
And openly or with appealing look<br />
Asking for sympathy.&nbsp; (The first blind step<br />
That leads from wifely honour down to shame,<br />
Is ofttimes hid with flowers of sympathy.)</p>
<p class="poetry"><a name="page8"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
8</span>He saw proud women who would flush and pale<br />
With sense of outraged modesty if one<br />
Spoke of the ancient sin before them, bare<br />
To all men&rsquo;s sight, or flimsily conceal<br />
By veils that bid adventurous eyes proceed,<br />
Charms meant alone for lover and for child.<br />
He saw chaste virgins tempt and tantalise,<br />
Lure and deny, invite&mdash;and then refuse,<br />
And drive men forth half crazed to wantons&rsquo; arms.</p>
<p class="poetry">Mother, you taught me there were but two
kinds<br />
Of women in the world&mdash;the good and bad.<br />
But you have been too sheltered in the safe,<br />
Old-fashioned sweetness of your quiet life,<br />
To know how women of these modern days<br />
Make licence of their new-found liberty.<br />
Why, I have been more tempted and more shocked<br />
By belles and beauties in the social whirl,<br />
By trusted wives and mothers in their homes,<br />
Than by the women of the underworld<br />
Who sell their favours.&nbsp; Do you think me mad?<br />
No, mother; I am sane, but very sad.</p>
<p class="poetry">I miss my boyhood&rsquo;s faith in
woman&rsquo;s worth&mdash;<br />
Torn from my heart, by &lsquo;good folks&rsquo; of the earth.</p>
<h2><a name="page9"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 9</span>THE
YOUNGER BORN</h2>
<p>The modern English-speaking young girl is the astonishment of
the world and the despair of the older generation.&nbsp; Nothing
like her has ever been seen or heard before.&nbsp; Alike in
drawing-rooms and the amusement places of the people, she defies
conventions in dress, speech, and conduct.&nbsp; She is bold, yet
not immoral.&nbsp; She is immodest, yet she is chaste.&nbsp; She
has no ideals, yet she is kind and generous.&nbsp; She is an
anomaly and a paradox.</p>
<p class="poetry"><span class="smcap"><i>We</i></span><i> are the
little daughters of Time and the World his wife</i>,<br />
<i>We are not like the children</i>, <i>born in their younger
life</i>,<br />
<i>We are marred with our mother&rsquo;s follies and torn with
our father&rsquo;s strife</i>.</p>
<p class="poetry">We are the little daughters of the modern
world,<br />
And Time, her spouse.<br />
She has brought many children to our father&rsquo;s house<br />
Before we came, when both our parents were content</p>
<p class="poetry"><a name="page10"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
10</span>With simple pleasures and with quiet homely ways.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Modest and mild<br />
Were the fair daughters born to them in those fair days,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Modest and mild.</p>
<p class="poetry"><i>But Father Time grew restless and longed for
a swifter pace</i>,<br />
<i>And our mother pushed out beside him at the cost of her tender
grace</i>,<br />
<i>And life was no more living but just a headlong race</i>.</p>
<p class="poetry">And we are wild&mdash;<br />
Yea, wild are we, the younger born of the World<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Into life&rsquo;s vortex hurled.<br />
With the milk of our mother&rsquo;s breast<br />
We drank her own unrest,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And we learned our speech from Time<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Who scoffs at the things sublime.<br />

Lightly we turn away.<br />
By strong compelling passion we are never stirred;<br />

We are the younger born, yet we are very old<br />
In understanding, and our knowledge makes us bold.<br />

14</span>HAPPINESS</h2>
<p class="poetry"><span class="smcap"><i>There</i></span><i> are
so many little things that make life beautiful</i>.<br />
I can recall a day in early youth when I was longing for
happiness.<br />
Toward the western hills I gazed, watching for its approach.<br
/>
The hills lay between me and the setting sun, and over them led a
highway.<br />
When some traveller crossed the hill, always a fine grey dust
rose cloudless against the sky.<br />
The traveller I could not distinguish, but the dust-cloud I could
see.</p>
<p class="poetry">And the dust-cloud seemed formed of hopes and
possibilities&mdash;each speck an embryo event.<br />
At sunset, when the skies were fair, the dust-cloud grew radiant
and shone with visions.<br />
<a name="page15"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 15</span>The
happiness for which I waited came not to me adown that western
slope,<br />
But now I can recall the cloud of golden dust, the sunset, and
the highway leading over the hill,<br />
The wonderful hope and expectancy of my heart, the visions of
youth in my eyes; and I know this was happiness.</p>
<p class="poetry"><i>There are so many little things that make
life beautiful</i>.<br />
I can recall another day when I rebelled at life&rsquo;s
monotony.<br />
Everywhere about me was the commonplace; and nothing seemed to
happen.<br />
Each day was like its yesterday, and to-morrow gave no promise of
change.<br />
My young heart rose rebellious in my breast; and I ran aimlessly
into the sunlight&mdash;the glowing sunlight of June.<br />
I sent out a dumb cry to Fate, demanding larger joys and more
delight.<br />
I ran blindly into a field of blooming clover.<br />
It was breast-high, and billowed about me like rose-red waves of
a fragrant sea.</p>
<p class="poetry"><a name="page16"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
16</span>The bees were singing above it; and their little brown
bodies were loaded with honey-dew, extracted from the clover
blossoms.<br />
The sun reeled in the heavens dizzy with its own splendour.<br />
The day went into night, without bringing any new event to change
my life.<br />
But now I recall the field of blooming clover, and the
honey-laden bees, the glorious June sunlight, and the passion of
youth in my heart; and I know that was happiness.</p>
<p class="poetry"><i>There are so many little things that make
life beautiful</i>.<br />
Yesterday a failure stared me in the face, where I had thought to
welcome proud success.<br />
There was no radiant cloud of dust against the western sky, and
no clover field lying fragrant under mid-June suns,<br />
Neither was youth with me any more.</p>
<p class="poetry">But under the vines that clung against my
walls, a flock of birds sought shelter just at twilight;<br />
<a name="page17"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 17</span>And,
standing at my casement, I could hear the twitter of their voices
and the soft, sweet flutter of their wings.<br />
Then over me there fell a sense of peace and calm, and love for
all created things, and trust illimitable.</p>

18</span>SEEKING FOR HAPPINESS</h2>
<p class="poetry"><span class="smcap">Seeking</span> for
happiness we must go slowly;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The road leads not down avenues of haste;<br />
But often gently winds through by ways lowly,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Whose hidden pleasures are serene and chaste<br />
Seeking for happiness we must take heed<br />
Of simple joys that are not found in speed.</p>
<p class="poetry">Eager for noon-time&rsquo;s large effulgent
splendour,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Too oft we miss the beauty of the dawn,<br />
Which tiptoes by us, evanescent, tender,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Its pure delights unrecognised till gone.<br />
Seeking for happiness we needs must care<br />
For all the little things that make life fair.</p>
<p class="poetry">Dreaming of future pleasures and
achievements<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; We must not let to-day starve at our door;<br />
Nor wait till after losses and bereavements<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Before we count the riches in our store.<br />
<a name="page19"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 19</span>Seeking
for happiness we must prize this&mdash;<br />
Not what will be, or was, but that which <i>is</i>.</p>
<p class="poetry">In simple pathways hand in hand with duty<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; (With faith and love, too, ever at her side),<br />
May happiness be met in all her beauty<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The while we search for her both far and wide.<br />
Seeking for happiness we find the way<br />
Doing the things we ought to do each day.</p>

To the wonderful Island of Endless Play.</p>
<p class="poetry">It lies off the border of &ldquo;No School

And abounds with pleasure, I understand.</p>
<p class="poetry">There boys go swimming whenever they please<br

In a lovely river right under the trees.</p>
<p class="poetry">And marbles are free, so you need not buy;<br

And kites of all sizes are ready to fly.</p>

<p class="poetry">Hurrah for the Island, so glad and free,<br />
That is the country for you and me.&rsquo;</p>

On a pleasure boat, in the lazy weather,<br />
And they sailed in the teeth of a friendly breeze<br />
Right into the harbour of &lsquo;Do-as-You-Please.&rsquo;<br />
Where boats and tackle and marbles and kites<br />
Were waiting them there in this Land of Delights.<br />
They dwelt on the Island of Endless Play<br />
For five long years; then one sad day<br />
A strange, dark ship sailed up to the strand,<br />
And &lsquo;Ho! for the voyage to Stupid Land,&rsquo;<br />
The captain cried, with a terrible noise,<br />
As he seized the frightened and struggling boys<br />
And threw them into the dark ship&rsquo;s hold;<br />
And off and away sailed the captain bold.<br />
They vainly begged him to let them out,<br />
He answered only with scoff and shout.<br />
<a name="page22"></a><span class="pagenum">p.

With Captain Time on the Pitiless Fate.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="poetry">He let out the sails and away went the three<br

Over the waters of Ignorant Sea,<br />
Out and away to Stupid Land;<br />

Small acts that are just and right;<br />

Of creeds that are pleasing to God,<br />
Not the chant of a prayer, or the hum of a hymn, or a jubilant

Of walking with feet faith-shod;<br />
And in loving, loving, loving through all, no matter how things

In trusting ever, though dark the day, and in keeping your hope

Soldiers and forts, and industries of death, and devil-ships, and
loud-winged devil-birds,<br />
All bent on slaughter and destruction.&nbsp; These and yet more
shameful things mine eyes beheld:<br />
Old men upon lascivious conquest bent, and young men living with

<p class="poetry"><span class="smcap">There</span> was a time
when I was confident<br />
That God&rsquo;s stupendous mystery of birth<br />
Was mine to know.&nbsp; The wonder of it lent<br />
New ecstasy and glory to the earth.<br />
I heard no voice that uttered it aloud,<br />
Nor was it written for me on a scroll;<br />
Yet, if alone or in the common crowd,<br />
I felt myself a consecrated soul.<br />
My child leaped in its dark and silent room<br />
And cried, &lsquo;I am,&rsquo; though all unheard by men.<br />
So leaps my spirit in the body&rsquo;s gloom<br />
And cries, &lsquo;I live!&nbsp; I shall be born again.&rsquo;<br

They did not ask or hope to enter in.<br />
&lsquo;We loved one woman (thus their story ran);<br />
We lost her, for she chose another man.<br />
So great our love, it brought us to this door;<br />
We only ask to see her face once more.<br />
Then will we go to realms where we belong,<br />
And pay our penalty for doing wrong.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="poetry">&lsquo;And wert thou friends on
earth?&rsquo;&nbsp; (The Guard spake thus.)<br />

Brought us together, comrades, to this goal,<br />
<a name="page47"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 47</span>To see her
face, and in its radiance bask<br />
For one great moment&mdash;that is all we ask.<br />

&lsquo;Wait, then,&rsquo; the Angel said, &lsquo;beside me
here,<br />
But do not strive within God&rsquo;s Gate to peer<br />
Nor converse hold with Spirits clothed in light<br />
Who pass this way; thou hast not earned the right.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="poetry">They waited year on year.&nbsp; Then, like a
flame,<br />
News of the woman&rsquo;s death from earth-land came.<br />
The eager lovers scanned with hungry eyes<br />
Each Soul that passed the Gates of Paradise.<br />
The well-beloved face in vain they sought,<br />
Until one day the Guardian Angel brought<br />
A message to them.&nbsp; &lsquo;She has gone,&rsquo; he said,<br
/>
&lsquo;Down to the lower regions of the dead;<br />
Her chosen mate went first; so great her love<br />
She has resigned the joys that wait above<br />
To dwell with him, until perchance some day,<br />
Absolved from sin, he seeks the Better Way.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="poetry">Silent, the lovers turned.&nbsp; The pitying
Guard<br />
Said: &lsquo;Stay (the while his hand the door unbarred),<br />

waits for thee no darker grief or woe;<br />

The dearest treasure by each mortal lost<br />
Lies yonder, when the Threshold has been crossed,<br />
And thou shalt find within that Sacred Place<br />
The shining wonder of her worshipped face.<br />
All that is past is but a troubled dream;<br />
Go forward now and claim the Fact Supreme.&rsquo;</p>

Not so we mount, not so we gain the race.<br />
Too loud the voice of commerce in the land;<br />
Not so truth speaks, not so we understand.<br />
Too vast our conquests, and too large our gains;<br />
Not so comes peace, not so the soul attains.</p>
<p class="poetry">But the need of the world is a faith that will
live anywhere;<br />
In the still dark depths of the woods, or out in the sun&rsquo;s
full glare.<br />
A faith that can hear God&rsquo;s voice, alike in the quiet
glen,<br />
Or in the roar of the street, and over the noises of men.</p>
<p class="poetry"><a name="page74"></a><span class="pagenum">p.

A creed with the turrets of hope and trust, no winds can
destroy;<br />
A creed where the soul finds rest, whatever this life bestows,<br
/>
And dwells undoubting and unafraid, because it knows, it
knows.</p>
<p class="poetry">And the need of the world is love that burns in
the heart like flame;<br />
A love for the Giver of Life, in sorrow or joy the same;<br />
A love that blazes a trail to Go through the dark and the
cold,<br />
Or keeps the pathway that leads to Him clean, through glory and
gold.</p>
<p class="poetry">For the faith that can only thrive or grow in
the solitude,<br />
And droops and dies in the marts of men, where sights and sounds
are rude;<br />
That is not a faith at all, but a dream of a mystic&rsquo;s
heart;<br />
Our faith should point as the compass points, whatever be the
chart.</p>
<p class="poetry"><a name="page75"></a><span class="pagenum">p.

call;<br />
And the faith that cannot do all this, that is not faith at
all.</p>

I fall asleep, brain weary and heart sore;<br />
But only for a little while.&nbsp; At three,<br />
Sometimes at two o&rsquo;clock, I wake and lie,<br />
Staring out into darkness; while my thoughts<br />
Begin the weary treadmill-toil again,<br />
From that white marriage morning of our youth<br />
Down to this dreadful hour.</p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I see your

Lit with the lovelight of the honeymoon;<br />
I hear your voice, that lingered on my name<br />
As if it loved each letter; and I feel<br />
The clinging of your arms about my form,<br />
Your kisses on my cheek&mdash;and long to break<br />
The anguish of such memories with tears,<br />
But cannot weep; the fountain has run dry.</p>

For more serene expression of man&rsquo;s love<br />
(The need to rest in calm affection&rsquo;s bay<br />
And not sail ever on the stormy main),<br />
Yet would I rouse myself to your desire;<br />
Meet ardent kiss with kisses just as warm;<br />
So nothing I could give should be denied.</p>
<p class="poetry">And then our children came.&nbsp; Deep in my

From the first hour of conscious motherhood,<br />
I knew I should conserve myself for this<br />
Most holy office; knew God meant it so.<br />
Yet even then, I held your wishes first;<br />
And by my double duties lost the bloom<br />
And freshness of my beauty; and beheld<br />
A look of disapproval in your eyes.<br />
But with the coming of our precious child,<br />
The lover&rsquo;s smile, tinged with the father&rsquo;s pride,<br

Returned again; and helped to make me strong;<br />
And life was very sweet for both of us.</p>

With my sweet babies.&nbsp; At the first you seemed<br />
To suffer with me, standing very near;<br />

And I was hurt, not realising then<br />
My grief was selfish.&nbsp; I could see the change<br />
Which motherhood and sorrow made in me;<br />
And when I saw the change that came to you,<br />
Saw how your eyes looked past me when you talked,<br />
And when I missed the love tone from your voice,<br />
I did that foolish thing weak women do,<br />
Complained and cried, accused you of neglect,<br />
And made myself obnoxious in your sight.</p>

With anger at my pallid cheeks, my dull<br />

And make new flames in dying embers leap,<br />
By such ungracious means?</p>

<p class="poetry">My God, my God, how have I borne it all!<br />
Yet since she had the power to wake that look&mdash;<br />
The power to sweep the ashes from your heart<br />
Of burned-out love of me, and light new fires,<br />
One thing remained for me&mdash;to let you go.<br />
I had no wish to keep the empty frame<br />
From which the priceless picture had been wrenched.<br />
Nor do I blame you; it was not your fault:<br />
You gave me all that most men can give&mdash;love<br />
Of youth, of beauty, and of passion; and<br />
I gave you full return; my womanhood<br />
Matched well your manhood.&nbsp; Yet had you grown ill,<br />
Or old, and unattractive from some cause<br />
(Less close than was my service unto you),<br />
I should have clung the tighter to you, dear;<br />
And loved you, loved you, loved you more and more.</p>

The Revealing Angels came.<br />
Suddenly and simultaneously, through city streets,<br />
Through quiet lanes and country roads they walked.<br />
They walked crying: &lsquo;God has sent us to find<br />
The vilest sinners of earth.<br />
We are to bring them before Him, before the Lord of
Life.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="poetry">Their voices were like bugles;<br />
And then all war, all strife,<br />
And all the noises of the world grew still;<br />
And no one talked;<br />
And no one toiled, but many strove to flee away.<br />
Robbers and thieves, and those sunk in drunkenness and crime,<br

<a name="page84"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 84</span>Men and

Another day, when we shall come again<br />
Unto the haunts of men,<br />
Then we will call your names;<br />
But God has asked us first to bring to him<br />
Those guilty of greater shames<br />
Than lust, or theft, or drunkenness, or vice&mdash;<br />
Yea, greater than murder done in passion,<br />
Or self-destruction done in dark despair.<br />

The sinful hosts.<br />

Some poorly clad, but many clothed like queens;<br />
They came from scenes of revel and from toil;<br />
From haunts of sin, from palaces, from homes,<br />
From boudoirs, and from churches.<br />

Angels they stood.<br />
And they heard the Angels say,<br />
And all the listening world heard the Angels say:<br />
&lsquo;These are the vilest sinners of all;<br />
For the Lord of Life made sex that birth might come;<br />
Made sex and its keen compelling desire<br />
To fashion bodies wherein souls might go<br />
From lower planes to higher,<br />
Until the end is reached (which is Beginning).<br />
They have stolen the costly pleasures of the senses<br />
And refused to pay God&rsquo;s price.<br />
They have come together, these men and these women,<br />
As male and female they have come together<br />
In the great creative act.<br />
They have invited souls, and then flung them out into space;<br

They have made a jest of God&rsquo;s design.<br />
All other sins look white beside this sinning;<br />

May then be the centre of thoughts and of deeds.<br />
<i>Yet some things ever must stay as they are</i><br />
<i>While the sea has its tide and the sky has its star</i>.<br />
A man and a woman and love undefiled<br />
And the look of the two in the face of a child,&mdash;<br />
Oh, the joys of this world have their changing ways,<br />
But this joy stays.<br />
Nothing better on earth can be<br />
Than just those three.</p>

UNWED MOTHER TO THE WIFE</h2>
<p class="poetry">I <span class="smcap">had</span> been almost
happy for an hour,<br />
Lost to the world that knew me in the park<br />
Among strange faces; while my little girl<br />
Leaped with the squirrels, chirruped with the birds<br />
And with the sunlight glowed.&nbsp; She was so dear,<br />
So beautiful, so sweet; and for the time<br />
The rose of love, shorn of its thorn of shame,<br />
Bloomed in my heart.&nbsp; Then suddenly you passed.<br />
I sat alone upon the public bench;<br />
You, with your lawful husband, rode in state;<br />
And when your eyes fell on me and my child,<br />
They were not eyes, but daggers, poison tipped.</p>
<p class="poetry">God! how good women slaughter with a look!<br
/>
And, like cold steel, your glance cut through my heart,<br />
<a name="page102"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 102</span>Struck
every petal from the rose of love<br />
And left the ragged stalk alive with thorns.</p>
<p class="poetry">My little one came running to my side<br />
And called me Mother.&nbsp; It was like a blow<br />
Between the eyes; and made me sick with pain.<br />
And then it seemed as if each bird and breeze<br />
Took up the word, and changed its syllables<br />
From Mother into Magdalene; and cried<br />
My shame to all the world.</p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was your
eyes<br />
Which did all this.&nbsp; But listen now to me<br />
(Not you alone, but all the barren wives<br />
Who, like you, flaunt their virtue in the face<br />
Of fallen women): I do chance to know<br />
The crimes you think are hidden from all men<br />
(Save one who took your gold and sold his skill<br />
And jeopardized his name for your base ends).</p>
<p class="poetry">I know how you have sunk your soul in sense<br
/>
Like any wanton; and refused to bear<br />
The harvest of your pleasure-planted seed;<br />
I know how you have crushed the tender bud<br />
Which held a soul; how you have blighted it;<br />
<a name="page103"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 103</span>And made
the holy miracle of birth<br />
A wicked travesty of God&rsquo;s design;<br />
Yea, many buds, which might be blossoms now<br />
And beautify your selfish, arid life,<br />
Have been destroyed, because you chose to keep<br />
The aimless freedom, and the purposeless,<br />
Self-seeking liberty of childless wives.</p>
<p class="poetry">I was an untaught girl.&nbsp; By nature led,<br
/>
By love and passion blinded, I became<br />
An unwed mother.&nbsp; You, an honoured wife,<br />
Refuse the crown of motherhood, defy<br />
The laws of nature, and fling baby souls<br />
Back in the face of God.&nbsp; And yet you dare<br />
Call me a sinner, and yourself a saint;<br />
And all the world smiles on you, and its doors<br />
Swing wide at your approach.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I stand outside.</p>
<p class="poetry">Surely there must be higher courts than
earth,<br />
Where you and I will some day meet and be<br />
Weighed by a larger justice.</p>

104</span>FATHER AND SON</h2>
<p class="poetry"><span class="smcap">My</span> grand-dame,
vigorous at eighty-one,<br />
Delights in talking of her only son,<br />
My gallant father, long since dead and gone.<br />
&lsquo;Ah, but he was the lad!&rsquo;<br />
She says, and sighs, and looks at me askance.<br />
How well I read the meaning of that glance&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &lsquo;Poor son of such a dad;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Poor weakling, dull and sad.&rsquo;<br />
I could, but would not tell her bitter truth<br />
About my father&rsquo;s youth.</p>
<p class="poetry">She says: &lsquo;Your father laughed his way
through earth:<br />
He laughed right in the doctor&rsquo;s face at birth,<br />
Such joy of life he had, such founts of mirth.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Ah, what a lad was he!&rsquo;<br />
And then she sighs.&nbsp; I feel her silent blame,<br />
Because I brought her nothing but his name.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; <a name="page105"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
105</span>Because she does not see<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Her worshipped son in me.<br />
I could, but would not, speak in my defence,<br />
Anent the difference.</p>
<p class="poetry">She says: &lsquo;He won all prizes in his
time:<br />
He overworked, and died before his prime.<br />
At high ambition&rsquo;s door I lay the crime.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Ah, what a lad he was!&rsquo;<br />
Well, let her rest in that deceiving thought,<br />
Of what avail to say, &lsquo;His death was brought<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; By broken sexual laws,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The ancient sinful cause.&rsquo;<br />
I could, but would not, tell the good old dame<br />
The story of his shame.</p>
<p class="poetry">I could say: &lsquo;I am crippled, weak, and
pale,<br />
Because my father was an unleashed male.<br />
Because he ran so fast, I halt and fail<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; (Ah, yes, he was the lad),<br />
Because he drained each cup of sense-delight<br />
I must go thirsting, thirsting, day and night.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Because he was joy-mad,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; I must be always sad.</p>
<p class="poetry"><a name="page106"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
106</span>Because he learned no law of self-control,<br />
I am a blighted soul.&rsquo;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Of what avail to speak and spoil her joy.<br />
Better to see her disapproving eyes,<br />
And silent, hear her say, between her sighs,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &lsquo;Ah, but he was the boy!&rsquo;</p>

107</span>HUSKS</h2>
<p class="poetry"><span class="smcap">She</span> looked at her
neighbour&rsquo;s house in the light of the waning day&mdash;<br
/>
A shower of rice on the steps, and the shreds of a bride&rsquo;s
bouquet.<br />
And then she drew the shade, to shut out the growing gloom,<br />
But she shut it into her heart instead.&nbsp; (Was that a voice
in the room?)</p>
<p class="poetry">&lsquo;My neighbour is sad,&rsquo; she sighed,
&lsquo;like the mother bird who sees<br />
The last of her brood fly out of the nest to make its home in the
trees&rsquo;&mdash;<br />
And then in a passion of tears&mdash;&lsquo;But, oh, to be sad
like her:<br />
Sad for a joy that has come and gone!&rsquo;&nbsp; (Did some one
speak, or stir?)</p>
<p class="poetry"><a name="page108"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
108</span>She looked at her faded hands, all burdened with costly
rings;<br />
She looked on her widowed home, all burdened with priceless
things.<br />
She thought of the dead years gone, of the empty years
ahead&mdash;<br />
(Yes, something stirred and something spake, and this was what it
said:)</p>
<p class="poetry">&lsquo;<i>The voice of the Might Have Been
speaks here through the lonely dusk</i>;<br />
<i>Life offered the fruits of love</i>; <i>you gathered only the
husk</i>.<br />
<i>There are jewels ablaze on your breast where never a child has
slept</i>.&rsquo;<br />
She covered her face with her ringed old hands, and wept and wept
and wept.</p>

109</span>MEDITATIONS</h2>
<h3>HIS</h3>
<p class="poetry">I <span class="smcap">was</span> so proud of
you last night, dear girl,<br />
While man with man was striving for your smile.<br />
You never lost your head, nor once dropped down<br />
From your high place<br />
As queen in that gay whirl.</p>
<p class="poetry">(It takes more poise to wear a little crown<br
/>
With modesty and grace<br />
Than to adorn the lordlier thrones of earth.)</p>
<p class="poetry">You seem so free from artifice and wile:<br />
And in your eyes I read<br />
Encouragement to my unspoken thought.<br />
My heart is eloquent with words to plead<br />
Its cause of passion; but my questioning mind,<br />
<a name="page110"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 110</span>Knowing
how love is blind,<br />
Dwells on the pros and cons, and God knows what.</p>
<p class="poetry">My heart cries with each beat,<br />
&lsquo;She is so beautiful, so pure, so sweet,<br />
So more than dear.&rsquo;<br />
And then I hear<br />
The voice of Reason, asking: &lsquo;Would she meet<br />
Life&rsquo;s common duties with good common sense?<br />
Could she bear quiet evenings at your hearth,<br />
And not be sighing for gay scenes of mirth?<br />
If, some great day, love&rsquo;s mighty recompense<br />
For chastity surrendered came to her,<br />
If she felt stir<br />
Beneath her heart a little pulse of life,<br />
Would she rejoice with holy pride and wonder,<br />
And find new glory in the name of wife?<br />
Or would she plot with sin, and seek to plunder<br />
Love&rsquo;s sanctuary, and cast away its treasure,<br />
That she might keep her freedom and her pleasure?<br />
Could she be loyal mate and mother dutiful?<br />
Or is she only some bright hothouse bloom,<br />
Seedless and beautiful,<br />
Meant just for decoration, and for show?&rsquo;<br />
Alone here in my room,<br />
<a name="page111"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 111</span>I hear
this voice of Reason.&nbsp; My poor heart<br />
Has ever but one answer to impart,<br />
&lsquo;I love her so.&rsquo;</p>
<h3>HERS</h3>
<p class="poetry">After the ball last night, when I came home<br
/>
I stood before my mirror, and took note<br />
Of all that men call beautiful.&nbsp; Delight,<br />
Keen sweet delight, possessed me, when I saw<br />
My own reflection smiling on me there,<br />
Because your eyes, through all the swirling hours,<br />
And in your slow good-night, had made a fact<br />
Of what before I fancied might be so;<br />
Yet knowing how men lie, by look and act,<br />
I still had doubted.&nbsp; But I doubt no more,<br />
I know you love me, love me.&nbsp; And I feel<br />
Your satisfaction in my comeliness.</p>
<p class="poetry">Beauty and youth, good health and willing
mind,<br />
A spotless reputation, and a heart<br />
Longing for mating and for motherhood,<br />
And lips unsullied by another&rsquo;s kiss&mdash;<br />
These are the riches I can bring to you.</p>
<p class="poetry">But as I sit here, thinking of it all<br />
In the clear light of morning, sudden fear<br />
<a name="page112"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 112</span>Has
seized upon me.&nbsp; What has been your past?<br />
From out the jungle of old reckless years,<br />
May serpents crawl across our path some day<br />
And pierce us with their fangs?&nbsp; Oh, I am not<br />
A prude or bigot; and I have not lived<br />
A score and three full years in ignorance<br />
Of human nature.&nbsp; Much I can condone;<br />
For well I know our kinship to the earth<br />
And all created things.&nbsp; Why, even I<br />
Have felt the burden of virginity,<br />
When flowers and birds and golden butterflies<br />
In early spring were mating; and I know<br />
How loud that call of sex must sound to man<br />
Above the feeble protest of the world.<br />
But I can hear from depths within my soul<br />
The voices of my unborn children cry<br />
For rightful heritage.&nbsp; (May God attune<br />
The souls of men, that they may hear and heed<br />
That plaintive voice above the call of sex;<br />
And may the world&rsquo;s weak protest swell into<br />
A thunderous diapason&mdash;a demand<br />
For cleaner fatherhood.)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Oh, love, come near;<br />
Look in my eyes, and say I need not fear.</p>

TRAVELLER</h2>
<p class="poetry"><span class="smcap">Bristling</span> with
steeples, high against the hill,<br />
Like some great thistle in the rosy dawn<br />
It stood; the Town-of-Christian-Churches, stood.<br />
The Traveller surveyed it with a smile.<br />
&lsquo;Surely,&rsquo; He said, &lsquo;here is the home of
peace;<br />
Here neighbour lives with neighbour in accord;<br />
God in the heart of all.&nbsp; Else why these spires?&rsquo;<br
/>
(Christmas season, and every bell ringing.)</p>
<p class="poetry">The sudden shriek of whistles changed the
sound<br />
From mellow music into jarring noise.<br />
Then down the street pale hurrying children came,<br />
And vanished in the yawning Factory door.<br />
He called to them: &lsquo;Come back, come unto Me.&rsquo;<br />
The Foreman cursed, and caned Him from the place.<br />
(Christmas season, and every bell ringing.)</p>
<p class="poetry"><a name="page114"></a><span class="pagenum">p.

Disputing loudly over boundary lines,<br />
Hate in their eyes, and murder in their hearts.<br />
A haughty woman drew her skirts aside<br />
Because her fallen sister passed that way.<br />
The Traveller rebuked them all.&nbsp; Amazed,<br />
They asked in indignation, &lsquo;Who are you,<br />
Daring to interfere in private lives?&rsquo;<br />
The Traveller replied, &lsquo;My name is CHRIST.&rsquo;<br />

O Average Man of the world&mdash;<br />
Average Man of the Christian world we call civilised?<br />
What have you done to pay for the labour pains of the mother who
bore you?<br />
On earth you occupy space; you consume oxygen from the air:<br />
And what do you give in return for these things?<br />
Who is better that you live, and strive, and toil?<br />
Or that you live through the toiling and striving of others?<br

As you pass down the street does any one look on you and say,<br

Look into your heart, O Woman! and answer this:<br />
What are you doing with the beautiful years?<br />
Is your to-day a better thing than was your yesterday?<br />
Have you grown in knowledge, grace, and usefulness?<br />
Or are you ravelling out the wonderful fabric knit by Time,<br />

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
